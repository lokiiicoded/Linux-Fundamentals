## ‚úÖ Step 1: Introduction to Linux

This section covers the core concepts of the Linux operating system.

### What Is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system kernel first created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. The kernel is the heart of the operating system, responsible for managing the computer's hardware and resources. The complete operating systems built around this kernel are known as **Linux distributions** (or "distros").

#### Key Concepts

*   **Kernel**: The core component of the OS that directly manages hardware, system calls, and process scheduling.
*   **User Space**: The environment where user applications, utilities, and services run, separate from the kernel.

### Why Use Linux?

*   **Open-Source and Free**: The source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute.
*   **Stability and Security**: Known for its robustness, making it a top choice for servers. It is also less prone to viruses compared to other systems.
*   **Efficiency**: Requires fewer resources to run, making it ideal for everything from old desktops to powerful cloud servers and tiny embedded devices (IoT).

### Popular Linux Distributions

A distribution bundles the Linux kernel with a desktop environment, command-line tools, and other software.

| Distribution | Primary Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ubuntu** | Beginner-friendly, with huge community support. Great for desktops and servers. |
| **Debian** | Known for its stability and reliability, often used for servers. |
| **Fedora** | A cutting-edge distribution that offers the latest software features. |
| **Arch Linux** | A "do-it-yourself" distro for advanced users who want full control. |
| **Kali Linux** | Specialized for penetration testing and cybersecurity tasks. |

### Linux vs. Windows Comparison

Here‚Äôs a quick look at how Linux differs from Windows:

| Feature | Linux | Windows |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost** | Free and Open-Source | Commercial (Requires a license) |
| **Terminal** | Powerful Command-Line Interface (CLI) is central to the OS. | Less powerful CMD/PowerShell; primarily GUI-driven. |
| **Package Manager** | Centralized software management (`apt`, `yum`, `pacman`). | Relies on individual installer `.exe` files. |
| **Stability** | Extremely stable, especially under heavy workloads. | Can be less stable under heavy load. |
| **Security** | Less targeted by malware and viruses due to its permission structure. | The most targeted OS for viruses. |

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Basic Linux Commands

The terminal is your most powerful tool in Linux. These commands are essential for everyday tasks.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Navigating Directories

These commands help you move around the file system.

*   **`pwd` (Print Working Directory)**: Shows your current folder location.
*   
    ```
    $ pwd
    /home/lokesh
    
    ```
*   **`ls` (List)**: Lists files and folders in the current directory.
    ```
    $ ls
    Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures
    ```
    *   `ls -l`: Shows a long listing with details like permissions, owner, size, and date.
    *   `ls -a`: Shows all files, including hidden ones (which start with a `.`).
*   **`cd` (Change Directory)**: Navigates to a different directory.
    ```
    $ cd /home/lokesh/Documents
    ```
    *   `cd ..`: Moves one directory level up.
    *   `cd ~`: Instantly returns to your home directory.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì File and Directory Operations

Commands for creating, copying, moving, and deleting files and folders.

*   **`mkdir` (Make Directory)**: Creates a new folder.
    ```
    $ mkdir new_project
    ```
*   **`touch` (Create Empty File)**: Creates a new, blank file.
    ```
    $ touch report.txt
    ```
*   **`cp` (Copy)**: Copies a file or directory.
    ```
    # Copy a file
    $ cp source.txt destination.txt

    # Copy a directory (requires -r for recursive)
    $ cp -r my_folder my_folder_backup
    ```
*   **`mv` (Move/Rename)**: Moves or renames a file or directory.
    ```
    # Rename a file
    $ mv old_name.txt new_name.txt

    # Move a file to another directory
    
    $ mv report.txt /home/lokesh/Documents/
    ```
*   **`rm` (Remove)**: Deletes files or directories. **Use with caution, as this is permanent!**
    ```
    # Remove a file
    $ rm report.txt

    # Remove a directory and all its contents (requires -r)
    $ rm -r old_project
    ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Viewing File Contents

*   **`cat`**: Displays the entire content of a file at once. Best for small files.
    ```
    $ cat config.txt
    ```
*   **`less` / `more`**: Displays file content one page at a time. Ideal for large files. Use arrow keys to scroll; press `q` to exit.
    ```
    $ less large_log_file.log
    ```
*   **`head` / `tail`**: Shows the first or last few lines of a file.
    ```
    # Show the first 10 lines
    $ head system.log

    # Show the last 5 lines
    $ tail -n 5 system.log
    ```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì System Information

*   **`uname -a`**: Displays detailed system and kernel information.
    ```
    $ uname -a
    Linux lokesh-PC 5.15.0-67-generic #... x86_64 GNU/Linux
    ```
*   **`df -h`**: Shows disk free space in a human-readable format (`-h`).
    ```
    $ df -h
    Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/sda1       100G   25G   70G  27% /
    ```
*   **`du -sh`**: Shows the total disk usage of a directory (`-s` for summary, `-h` for human-readable).
    ```
    $ du -sh /home/lokesh/Documents
    1.5G    /home/lokesh/Documents
    ```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì File Permissions and Ownership

*   **`ls -l`**: The long listing format shows permissions (`-rw-r--r--`), owner (`lokesh`), and group (`lokesh`).
    ```
    $ ls -l
    -rw-r--r-- 1 lokesh lokesh  512 Aug 25 10:00 file1.txt
    ```
    *   Permissions are `r` (read), `w` (write), `x` (execute) for the owner, group, and others.
*   **`chmod` (Change Mode)**: Modifies file or directory permissions.
    ```
    # Give owner, group, and others read/execute permissions (755)
    $ chmod 755 script.sh

    # Add execute permission for the owner
    $ chmod u+x script.sh
    ```
*   **`chown` (Change Owner)**: Changes the owner and group of a file.
    ```
    $ sudo chown user1:group1 file.txt
    ```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Searching for Files

*   **`find`**: A powerful tool to search for files based on name, size, type, and more.
    ```
    $ find /home/lokesh -name "*.txt"
    ```
*   **`locate`**: A faster (but less flexible) alternative that uses a pre-built database.
    ```
    $ locate report.txt
    ```

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Package Management in Linux

A package manager automates installing, updating, and removing software. The command you use depends on your Linux distro.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Debian-based Systems (Ubuntu, Debian)

Uses the **`apt` (Advanced Package Tool)**.

*   **Update Package List**: Always do this first!
    ```
    $ sudo apt update
    ```
*   **Install a Package**:
    ```
    $ sudo apt install curl
    ```
*   **Remove a Package**:
    ```
    $ sudo apt remove curl
    ```
*   **Upgrade All Packages**:
    ```
    $ sudo apt upgrade
    ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì RedHat-based Systems (CentOS, Fedora)

Uses **`dnf`** (or the older `yum`).

*   **Install a Package**:
    ```
    $ sudo dnf install curl
    ```
*   **Remove a Package**:
    ```
    $ sudo dnf remove curl
    ```
*   **Update System**:
    ```
    $ sudo dnf update
    ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Universal Package Systems

These work across most Linux distributions.

*   **Snap**:
    ```
    # Install
    $ sudo snap install spotify
    # Remove
    $ sudo snap remove spotify
    ```
*   **Flatpak**:
    ```
    # Install
    $ flatpak install flathub com.spotify.Client
    # Run
    $ flatpak run com.spotify.Client
    ```

## ‚úÖ Step 4: User and Group Management

Linux is a multi-user system. These commands help you manage users, groups, and their permissions.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Basic User Commands

*   **Add a New User**:
    ```
    $ sudo adduser newuser
    ```
    This command interactively prompts for a password and user details.
*   **Delete a User**:
    ```
    # Remove the user but keep their files
    $ sudo deluser newuser

    # Remove the user AND their home directory
    $ sudo deluser --remove-home newuser
    ```
*   **Change User Password**:
    ```
    $ sudo passwd newuser
    ```
*   **Switch User**:
    ```
    $ su - newuser
    ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Managing Groups

*   **Create a New Group**:
    ```
    $ sudo groupadd developers
    ```
*   **Add a User to a Group**:
    ```
    # The -aG flags APPEND the group, which is important!
    $ sudo usermod -aG developers lokesh
    ```
*   **List a User's Groups**:
    ```
    $ groups lokesh
    ```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ ‚Äì Viewing User Information

*   **`whoami`**: Shows the current user.
*   **`who`**: Lists all users currently logged in.
*   **`id`**: Displays detailed user and group ID information.
    ```
    $ id lokesh
    uid=1001(lokesh) gid=1001(lokesh) groups=1001(lokesh),1002(developers)
    ```
